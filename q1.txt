The Viterbi algorithm is a method for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states that
could have generated a sequence of observed events.
It does not always find the optimal solution,
but its performance can be affected by factors such as the model used and the
length of the observed sequence.

Yes, the Viterbi algorithm finds the most likely sequence of hidden states that could have
generated a sequence of observations.
It uses dynamic programming to search through all possible combinations of hidden states
and select the sequence with the highest probability of generating the observed sequence.
