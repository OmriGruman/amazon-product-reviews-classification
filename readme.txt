To solve this classification problem, one approach would be to use a machine learning algorithm that is specifically designed for text classification. One such algorithm is the support vector machine (SVM), which can be trained on the training data to learn the relationship between the review text and its rating.

To implement the classify() function, we would first need to preprocess the train and test data to extract the review text and ratings. This can be done by parsing the JSON objects and extracting the relevant fields. We would then need to convert the text data into a numerical format that the SVM algorithm can process, such as a matrix of token counts or word vectors.

Next, we would train the SVM model on the preprocessed training data, using the ratings as the labels. Once the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on the test data. To evaluate the performance of the model, we can compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each class, as well as the overall accuracy.

Finally, we can return a dictionary with the F1 scores and overall accuracy as the output of the classify() function.
